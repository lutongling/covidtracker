README:

1. You are recommended to run this application program on Windows 10, using a Pycharm IDE.

2. Tkinter is a Python built-in package but the import syntax is different in Python 2, so make sure you are under Python 3.

3. pymysql module should be pre-installed for connecting the Database.
   Using this website for reference: https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/

4. There are no other modules that would be used. All the other imports are different python files for this project.

5. Make sure covid_tracker.png is in this project package. It is the background picture for the login window.
   (If it goes wrong, just comment the code in login.py line 21-24, and run again)

6. ***IMPORTANT NOTICE:
   To connect the database, you need to modify the code(below within the quotation mark) in db.py line 9.
   In db.py at line 9:
   you should put your own database user and password to user= "your_db_user" & password= "your_db_password"

7. This is implemented in a Desktop machine so the size may seem a bit inappropriate in your machine.
   But the video of my presentation for this project will show you the well fitted size on my Desktop.
